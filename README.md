# OpenDR datasets

This repository contains datasets collected and annotated within the scopes of the [OpenDR](https://github.com/opendr-eu/opendr) project. The datasets are read in `opendr` format, but they can also be downloaded in their raw format and used in any tool. 

## Installation and requirements

The OpenDR toolkit is an _optional_ requirement of this package, only needed if you plan to use these datasets with an OpenDR tool. For full integration, the [OpenDR](https://github.com/opendr-eu/opendr) toolkit must be installed first.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/opendr-eu/datasets.git
```

If you don't plan on using other OpenDR tools, the datasets can be downloaded from their corresponding README pages, and there is no need to install this package.
