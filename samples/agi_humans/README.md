This is a 2D Object Detection dataset, collected by AGI using Robotti equipped with a front and back camera.
The dataset is split in train and test sets, and each of these is split in two subsets: a) images depicting humans, and b) images with no humans. The dataset is annotated using the [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) tool in VOC style .xml format.
